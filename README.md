# Hydra transposable element analyses
Hydra is a freshwater cnidarian known for its remarkable regenerative abilities, absence of aging, and asexual reproduction. The brown hydra, a significant clade within the hydra species, possesses an expanded genome resulting from the proliferation of transposable elements (TEs). In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of TEs within the hydra genome.
